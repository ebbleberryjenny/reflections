1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository is created, but there are no contents.  It is needed for the organizational
structure of the repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the "pre-commit" phase; it gives you a chance to review the changes
before making it a commit.  It allows for a great deal of control over a commit.
