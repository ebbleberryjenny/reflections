1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be helpful if you are accessing your work from multiple
computers or if you intend for other people to contribute to your work.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull changes manually in order to make sure that the changes you are
bringing into your local computer are ones that you want to make.
