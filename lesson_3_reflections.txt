1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be helpful if you are accessing your work from multiple
computers or if you intend for other people to contribute to your work.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull changes manually in order to make sure that the changes you are
bringing into your local computer are ones that you want to make.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forks are used to make copies of another person's work on GitHub that you would like
to make changes to.  Clones are exact copies of a repository, on your local computer.
Branches are changes to a repository that can be found either on GitHub or locally.  Forks
are used if you would like to change someone else's work; Clones are useful if you want an exact
copy of your own work.  Branches are used to make experimental changes in a repository, but
still keep the original copy.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is useful if you want to work on the remote without internet access, or if you
want to make changes independently of someone else working on the same repository.
